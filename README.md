## Learning Mapping Rules for Ontology to Relational Alignment

This codebase has two independent parts:

- There is an **Extraction** module, responsible for extracting disjunctive datasets from the [RODI benchmark](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RODI/), which is described in [extract/README.md](extract/README.md). This section also describes how to extract the datasets used in the paper.

- There is a **Learning** module, responsible for training models on disjunctive datasets, which is described in [learn/README.md](learn/README.md). This section describes how to run particular experiments mentioned in the paper.
